You have to start delegating for various of reasons:</p><ul><li>Not losing time on repetitive tasks that you already did many times,</li><li>Helping others to grow by letting them doing things independently,</li><li>Growing your successors after you&#39;ll switch to another role,</li><li>Doing more complex projects where more people are involved and not only you,</li><li>Having more time for engaging to new initiavites where your experience is really needed, a not where that is comfortable for you.</li></ul><p>Now, there are two main ways of delegating things:</p><ul><li>Assigning tasks,</li><li>Delegating responsibilities.</li></ul><p>Every time you assign a task to someone, you&#39;ll have to supervise that task progress and completion. It&#39;s time consuming. You can imagine supervising hundreds of small tasks. At some point what you want to achieve is a team of trusted people who will take the responsibility from you with consequences of being successful or unsuccessful. When you&#39;ll have that, you will only have to require from them a cyclic report with some numbers and a lesson learned use cases, if there were any challenges. Of course, if your apprentices will start failing frequently, you&#39;ll have to get back to stricter supervision again.</p><h2 id="on-self-coaching" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#on-self-coaching"><span>On self-coaching</span></a></h2><p>As your workers grow in seniority, they may not need supervision anymore, but coaching. You&#39;ll start discussing with them some situations that happened during the meetings or simply solving daily problems. Your worker will come to you with some problem and you&#39;ll ask them: <em>- What do you want to achieve?</em> and <em>- What steps do you need to solve that?</em> When you&#39;re asking these questions as a coach, you&#39;re delegating things back to your interlocutors and you&#39;re letting them face the problem by themselves. That will benefit in the future by having a worker who doesn&#39;t require leading by the hand.</p><p>The final form of coaching would be to teach your workers how to coach themselves. Next time they come to you for an advice, ask them: <em>- If you would be your coach, what would you tell/ask yourself?</em> This question is especially powerfull when you&#39;re under huge stress and you have negative thoughts that stops you from doing something. As a coach of yourself you&#39;ll usually try to cheer yourself up, and explain something to yourself with unnecessary emotions or even with positive energy.</p><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#references"><span>References</span></a></h2><ul><li>Blanchard, Ken, <em>One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey</em>, 2000.</li><li>Hastings, Reed and Meyer, Erin, <em>No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention</em>, 2020.</li></ul><p><em>Article originally written 2023.04.13</em></p>',14)]))}const h=t(a,[["render",s],["__file","delegating.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/post/2023/04/13/delegating.html","title":"On delegating and self-coaching","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"permalinkPattern":"/post/:year/:month/:day/:slug.html","date":"2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","tag":["delegating","coaching"],"author":"Piotr Przetacznik","sidebar":"heading","location":"Krak√≥w"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"On delegating","slug":"on-delegating","link":"#on-delegating","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"On self-coaching","slug":"on-self-coaching","link":"#on-self-coaching","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"References","slug":"references","link":"#references","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1736687039000},"filePathRelative":"_posts/2023-03-28-delegating.md","excerpt":"\\n<p>The highest form of delegating is delegating responsibilities and the highest form of coaching is self-coaching.</p>\\n<h2>On delegating</h2>\\n<p>To be an effective leader, you need to start making bigger impact by delegating things on others.
